	- input shouldn't expand widthwise, should scroll to keep cursor in view
	- backspace symbol before division - you end up in the numerator
	- should an empty expression really be an error?
	- can't click on empty nodes above/below division
	- output of (1+2)x is wrong - brackets need to be included
				- (1+2)x is correct in admSemantic, OpenMath, not in Latex, admLiteral
		- also -2x
		- also implicit times, I'm going to need to build on top of pure OpenMath
		- although brackets shouldn't require altering the OpenMath, they can be determined programatically

	- semanticError should only be inserted if output mode is OpenMath, all LaTeX is valid
	- any type of error inside parentheses is reported as an empty expression
	- exponent node should probably disappear if it loses focus while empty
	- nodeClick (and goToPos, possibly others) don't handle nested Expressions
	
	- using admHook to insert object (e.g. pressing button on admFullMathInput) moves cursor to end
	- repro:
		- type "12"
		- move cursor between '1' and '2'
		- press "\pi" button
	
	- f(x) can't be converted to f*x (at least on admPlot, it's a very difficult problem to solve in terms of actual parsing)
	
	- admPlot replace admXMin/Max with admXRange, admYMin/Max with admYRange?

MATH FEATURES NEEDING IMPLEMENTING
	- arcsin, arccos, arctan (including plotting)
	- fill in area of graph (or intersection between two lines?)
