	- indicate somewhere in the field if the parser can parse the input (red background on wrong?)
	- should an empty expression really be an error?
	- colour empty literalExpressions so people can see where they are
	- can't click on empty nodes above/below division

	- semantic.nodeTypes.Error should only be inserted if output mode is OpenMath, all LaTeX is valid
		- also, like, build in Latex support
	- any type of error inside parentheses is reported as an empty expression
	- exponent node should probably disappear if it loses focus while empty
	- nodeClick (and goToPos, possibly others) don't handle nested Expressions
