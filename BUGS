	- backspace symbol before division - you end up in the numerator
	- should an empty expression really be an error?
	- can't click on empty nodes above/below division
	- output of (1+2)x is wrong - brackets need to be included
		- also -2x
		- also implicit times, I'm going to need to build on top of pure OpenMath
		- although brackets shouldn't require altering the OpenMath, they can be determined programatically

	- semanticError should only be inserted if output mode is OpenMath, all LaTeX is valid
		- also, like, build in Latex support
	- any type of error inside parentheses is reported as an empty expression
	- exponent node should probably disappear if it loses focus while empty
	- nodeClick (and goToPos, possibly others) don't handle nested Expressions

MATH FEATURES NEEDING IMPLEMENTING
	- non-square root
	- abs
	- log
